However, the user can disable cookies through his/her web or mobile device browser settings, but some features of the Platform may not function properly.

    <p>Servers automatically record information created by user’s use of the Platform. This data may include information such as user’s IP address, browser type, operating system, the
    referring web page, pages visited, location, user’s mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. Log data is received when user interact with the
    Platform. The data is used to enable the Platform to measure, customize, and improve it.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Third-party services:</strong>
    <p>MlympiX uses a variety of third-party services to help its provision on the Platform, such as hosting and other services. These third-party service providers may collect information
    sent by user’s browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or IP address, location and devices’ unique identifiers. Also, third-party ad partners may share
    information to measure ad quality and tailor ads, for example to display ads about things user may have already shown interest in.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Customer Support Correspondence:</strong>
    <p>MlympiX may collect contact information, the information relating to the games played and/or any activity performed on the Platform, the correspondence and any other information, etc. as is provided by the user while seeking Helpdesk assistance. The

    information/updation/modification, etc. relating to Platform and others to the users. The user may use his/her account settings to unsubscribe the notifications from MlympiX and/or from other users including third parties by following the instructions contained

    the user. To the extent possible, MlympiX provide the option of not divulging any specific information that the user choose for not to collect, store or use by the MlympiX. The user
    may also choose not to use a particular service or feature on the Platform and opt-out of any non-essential communications from the platform.
    Further, transacting over the internet itself has inherent risks which can only be avoided by following security practices such as not revealing account/login related information, etc. to
    any other person(s) by the user. However, in case of user’s account has been compromised in one way or other, Helpdesk assistance of MlympiX can be accessed by the user.
    </p>

    <p>The Personal Information provided by the user may be used for various purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>a. For maintaining internal records;</ul>

    MlympiX will not sell, share, license to use user’s personal information to others until and unless it is required to provide, maintain, optimise, improve, support, etc. services to users
    and/or required under any law or in compliance to court order and/or for the purposes mentioned hereunder clause 12 or other clauses of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <li><strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE:</strong>
    <p>MlympiX will share user’s data with third parties according to the Privacy Policy only, as is reasonably necessary to carry out user’s instructions, e.g. user information has to be
    provided to the payment processors to process a payment instruction; where user data is on an anonymous and aggregated basis, meaning by user could not be personally identified
    from it; for the delivery of Interest-Based Advertising in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy; when user submit information as part of a competition or otherwise interact with
    any channel or social media, the submitted information may be published; as it’s reasonably believed is permitted by law or regulation; in order to comply with any legal
    obligation, or in order to enforce or apply the Terms, this Privacy Policy and/or any other agreement with user; or to protect the rights and/or property of MlympiX or third-party´s
    rights and/or property.</p>
    <p>MlympiX may share or disclose user’s non-private information, such as public user profile information, public messages, e-mail, etc., or share or disclose user information in an
    anonymous or aggregated basis in a manner that does not allow user’s personal identification. Therefore, although MlympiX uses industry-standard practices to protect
    user privacy, the MlympiX do not promise, and user should not expect, that user personally identifiable information or private communications would always remain private.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>EXTERNAL LINKS ON THE PLATFORM:</strong>
    <p>The Platform may include advertisements, hyperlinks to other websites, applications, content or resources. MlympiX have no control over any websites or resources, which are
    provided by companies or persons other than MlympiX. The user acknowledges and agrees that MlympiX is not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, services or other
    materials on or available from such platform or resources. Also, the user acknowledges and agrees that MlympiX is not liable for any loss(es) or damage(s) which may be incurred by
    the user as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by the user on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any
    advertising, services or other materials on, or available from, such websites or resources.</p>
    <p>
    These external websites and resource providers may have their own privacy policies governing the collection, storage, retention and disclosure of user’s Personal Information
    that the user may be subject to. MlympiX recommends that the user enters the external websites and review their privacy policies at his/her own.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong> CONFIDENTIALITY:</strong>
    <p>The user further acknowledges that the Platform may contain information which is
    designated confidential by MlympiX and that the user shall not disclose such information without prior written consent of the MlympiX. The user’s information is regarded as
    confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third party, unless if legally required to do so to the appropriate authorities. MlympiX will not sell, share, or rent user’s personal
    information to any third party or use user’s e-mail address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by the MlympiX will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services, and
    the user retain sole discretion to seek for discontinuation of such communications at any point of time.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING USER PROFILE:</strong>
    <p>The user can, anytime, review and change the information which were submitted at the time of registration but for State name, Email ID and Mobile number. An option for facilitating such change shall be available on the Platform and such change shall be
    effected by the User. MlympiX may or may not keep track of information changed by the user. MlympiX shall not be liable to retain the information removed by the user or on
    user’s request for future which may be warranted by the user to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems, to enforce terms and conditions, etc. Such prior/old information shall be completely removed from the databases including stored ‘back up’ systems of the MlympiX. The user’s information, if any, held by the MlympiX is incorrect or incomplete as per the user’s belief or the user wish to remove his/her profile to make it invisible for
    others, the user needs to remediate and promptly correct or get it corrected.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong> CONTROL OF USER PASSWORD:</strong>
    <p>The user is solely and entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her password. It is important to choose the password carefully by the user and keeping the
    password as well as computer or other device fully secured by signing out after every use of MlympiX services by the user. The user agrees not to use the account, username, email address or password of another
    user at any time or to disclose his/her password to any third party. Only user is responsible for all actions taken with his/her login information and password, including fees. If the user
    loses control of his/her password, the user may lose substantial control over his/her personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on
    his/her behalf. Therefore, if user’s password has been compromised for any reason, the user should immediately change his/her password and may notify the MlympiX if the user
    suspect any consistent unauthorized use of his/her account or access to his/her password even after changing the same.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong> SECURITY:</strong>
    <p>MlympiX maintains appropriate technical and physical safeguards to protect information against accidental or unlawful destruction or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosures or
    access, and any other unlawful forms of processing of the data in its possession. However, MlympiX does not guarantee that Information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or
    destroyed by breach of any of the abovementioned safeguards. Information may be transferred to and/or stored at worldwide destinations. MlympiX takes all steps reasonably
    necessary to ensure that Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In the event that MlympiX is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,
    reorganization or sale of assets, User Information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The undertakings in this Privacy Policy shall apply to the Information as
    transferred to the new entity. MlympiX treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. MlympiX employs many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside MlympiX. MlympiX follows generally
    accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to the MlympiX and information that the MlympiX has accessed.
    However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. MlympiX cannot guarantee the security of it’s database, nor can guarantee that information
    which the user provide won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to MlympiX over the Internet. Irrespective of which country the user reside in or supply information from, the user
    authorize MlympiX to store and/or use the Information according to this Privacy Policy in any country where MlympiX may operate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, MlympiX may preserve or disclose
    User Information to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical
    issues; or to protect MlympiX's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defences or objections that user may have to a third party’s, including a government’s request to disclose User Information. MlympiX wants to make
    sure that User Information is accurate and up to date.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong> SEVERABILITY:</strong>
    <p>Each paragraph of this Privacy Policy shall be and remain separate from and independent of and severable from all and any other paragraphs herein except where otherwise
    expressly indicated or indicated by the context of the agreement. The decision or declaration that one or more of the paragraphs are null and void shall have no effect on the
    remaining paragraphs of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>AMENDMENT:</strong>
    <p>Privacy Policy may change from time to time and the most current version of the policy available on the Platform will prevail. Any amendments to this Policy shall be deemed as
    accepted by the User on their continued use of the Platform.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong> GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION:</strong>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the prevalent laws of India. Any dispute arising in connection with this Privacy Policy shall be governed in
    accordance with the Terms.</p>
