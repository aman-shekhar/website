<ol start="14"><br>
<li><strong> SECURITY</strong></li>

We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the Company. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us and information that we have accessed.</p>
